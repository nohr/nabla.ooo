This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Parts of the canvas were adapted from [frosty-reflector](https://codesandbox.io/s/23xxw) by Marco Ludovico Perego.
Many of the SVG icons used were either created by me or sourced from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).
